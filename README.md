# BowlingScoresCalculatorUsingCppStruct

This program reads the names and scores of bowlers from a text file; each line of the text file contains a name followed by four bowling scores,
each separated by a space; there are 10 lines in the text file, so there is data for 10 bowlers

This program then calculates each bowler's average score and prints their names, scores, and average score to the console

This program has been revised to accept five scores from the text file for each bowler
